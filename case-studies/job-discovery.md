# Transparent Job Discovery & Referral Platform (Concept)

*A privacy-first approach to job discovery, referrals, and hiring visibility*

---

## Problem
Job seekers navigate fragmented platforms with limited transparency. Applications lack status visibility, referrals disappear into black boxes, and access to recruiters is often gated behind paid tiers.

---

## Users
- Job seekers
- Hiring managers and HR teams
- Referrers (employees, alumni, connectors)

---

## Product Vision
Create a transparent, privacy-first job discovery platform that improves relevance, accountability, and trust — without monetising access to opportunity.

---

## Key Problems Identified
### Job Seekers
- No visibility into application status
- Stale or obsolete job postings
- Paid access for basic discoverability

### HR Teams
- No accountability for outdated postings
- High inbound noise with low-quality signals

### Referrers
- No feedback loop after referrals
- No structured way to connect responsibly

---
