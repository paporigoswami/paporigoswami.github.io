## Featured Case Study: iECHO Platform Evolution

### Overview
iECHO is a digital tele-mentoring and community platform supporting large-scale, live, mentor-led programs across public health and education. As the platform scaled, partners needed clearer visibility into program performance, stronger peer engagement beyond live sessions, and better recognition of individual contribution.

This work focused on four distinct platform features that evolved iECHO from an operational tool into an insight- and community-driven product.

---

### 1. Analytics
**Problem**  
Program teams lacked a single, self-serve view of program health and engagement. Reporting was fragmented and heavily dependent on support teams.

**Solution**  
Designed and rolled out self-serve analytics focused on real program operations rather than vanity metrics.

**Key Capabilities**
- Program health overview
- Attendance and participation trends
- Engagement patterns across sessions and batches
- Downloadable insights for reporting

**Impact**
- Reduced recurring analytics queries
- Improved decision-making for Hub admins
- Established analytics as a core product surface

---

### 2. Beta (New Product Introduction)
**Problem**  
Analytics and community features introduced new mental models for users, creating risk of low adoption if launched directly to GA.

**Solution**  
Introduced controlled beta rollouts with clear scope, enablement, and structured feedback loops.

**Outcome**
- Validated usability in real program contexts
- Identified gaps before GA release
- De-risked platform-wide rollout

---

### 3. Community
**Problem**  
Learning and interaction were limited to live sessions, with no persistent space for peer exchange or collaboration.

**Solution**  
Built structured on-platform community components aligned with the ECHO model.

**Key Elements**
- Collaboratives and discussions
- Public profiles and visibility
- Clear usage guidelines and best practices

**Impact**
- Increased post-session engagement
- Strengthened peer-to-peer learning
- Positioned iECHO as a community platform, not just a session tool

---

### 4. iECHO Wrapped
**Problem**  
Users had limited visibility into their individual participation and impact, making engagement feel invisible over time.

**Solution**  
Conceptualised and delivered iECHO Wrapped — a personalised, year-end product experience highlighting individual contribution and engagement.

**Highlights**
- Sessions attended and contributions made
- Role-based views for participants and organisations
- Visual, shareable summaries

**Outcome**
- Increased user recognition and recall
- Reinforced sense of belonging and contribution
- Positioned engagement data as meaningful, not transactional

---

## Key Learnings
- Analytics adoption depends on interpretability, not just data availability
- Beta is critical when introducing new product behaviour
- Community features need structure to scale meaningfully
- Personalised storytelling drives emotional engagement with platforms
